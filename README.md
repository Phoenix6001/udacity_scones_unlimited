## Project: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker

### Overview

In this project, weâ€™ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an **image classification model** that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. We'll deploy our model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose our model and services into an event-driven application.
